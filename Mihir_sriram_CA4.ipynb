    "# B-Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "B-tree is a common data structure for managing data stored in hard disks. Because of the mechanincal movements of hard disks (arm moving and disk spining), it is most economical to bring a large chunk of data stored consecutively into the main memory in one disk-read operation and write a large chunkof data to a disk in one disk-read operation. This chunk of data is called a page. The size of one page ranges from $2^{11} = 2,048$ bytes to $2^{14} = 16,384$ bytes. B-tree stores one page of data in one node. To facilitate searching, each internal node can hold multiple keys. To cut down disk accesses, we want a B-tree to be short.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Disk.png\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical pattern for working with an object is as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "$x$ is a pointer to some object\n",
    "DISK-READ($x$)\n",
    "operations that access and/or modify the attributes of $x$\n",
    "DISK-WRITE($x$) (omitted if no attributes of x were changed)\n",
    "other operations that access but do not modify attributes of $x$\n",
    "\n",
    "In a B-tree, as in any form of BST, any \"satellite information” (data) associated with a key resides in the same node as the key. Or we may think of a key as a point to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a variant of B-tree called B$^+$-tree, all the satellite information (data) is stored in the leaves and the internal nodes only store keys and child pointers. This maximizes the branching factor of the internal nodes."

    "## B-tree definition \n",
    "\n",
    "A tree $T$ is a B-tree if it satisfies the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All leaves are at the same level.\n",
    "2. Let $t\\geq 2$ be a positive integer called a minimum degree, whose value is determined by the page size.\n",
    "3. Every node except the root must contain at least $t-1$ keys. If $T$ is not empty, then the root contains one or more keys.\n",
    "4. All nodes (the root included) may contain upto $2t – 1$ keys. A node is full if it contains exactly $2t-1$ keys.\n",
    "5. Each internal node of $k$ keys has $k+1$ children. Thus, an internal node may have at most $2t$ children. \n",
    "6. Keys of a node are sorted in increasing order. The child between two keys $k_1$ and $k_2$ contains all keys in the range between $k_1$ and $k_2$.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. B-Tree grows and shrinks from the root. This is different from BST, which grows downward and shrinks upward.\n",
    "2. Inserting a new node in B-tree happens only at the leave level.\n",
    "3. Like other balanced BST such as AVL and red-black trees, each operation of search, insert, and delete incurs $O(\\log_t n) = O(\\log n)$ disk accesses (see below), since the minimum degree $t$ is a constant.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Any nodes that are passed as parameters must already have had a disk-read operation performed on them.\n",
